ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification â€“ Model Deployment with Render
This project involves building and deploying a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on their physical characteristics. The model is trained on the classic Iris dataset, which is widely used in pattern recognition and machine learning.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Description:
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of iris flowers:

Iris setosa

Iris versicolor

Iris virginica

Each sample contains four features:

sepal length (cm)

sepal width (cm)

petal length (cm)

petal width (cm)
